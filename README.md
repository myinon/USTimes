USTimes
=======

A small program to help convert between the four time zones of the continental United States: US/Eastern, US/Central, US/Mountain, and US/Pacific.

Each time zone is shown on its own row with a time spinner that can be edited in one of three ways:
 * Clicking on the visible up/down arrows
 * Using your keyboard's up/down arrows or manually typing in a time
 * Using your mouse's scroll wheel if it has one
   
   ###### Note:
   The mouse must be above one of the four spinners for this to work. Also, when using the scroll wheel on a spinner that is not currently selected, it will only increment/decrement the time by hours. To increment/decrement by minutes or seconds, the minutes or seconds section of the time must be selected and the mouse must be over the selected time.

This program includes a button to reset to the current time. It will also highlight the time zone that you currently reside in with the color red.
